Using pattern matching with string data
Examples:

LIKE: /* LIKE is a key sensitive.
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM customer
WHERE first_name LIKE 'J%' AND last_name LIKE 'S%'

ILIKE: /* ILIKE is case insensitive */
SELECT * FROM customer
WHERE first_name ILIKE 'j%' AND last_name ILIKE 's%'

The LIKE statment with who has 'er' somewhere in their first name:
SELECT * FROM customer
WHERE first_name LIKE '%er%'

#another one statment where we are using a _ underscore with percent % to sort vaule which meet the conditions
SELECT * FROM customer
WHERE first_name NOT LIKE '_her%'

/* filtered by using 'A%' and sorded byt last name withc limit 10 rows  
SELECT * FROM customer
WHERE first_name LIKE 'A%'
ORDER BY last_name
LIMIT 10

pattern = wzor
SELECT * FROM customer
WHERE first_name LIKE 'A%' AND last_name NOT LIKE 'B%'
ORDER BY last_name
LIMIT 10
